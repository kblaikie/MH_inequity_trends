# MH_inequity_trends
This repository hosts analytic scripts and data summaries for an under-review project documenting how social inequities in mental health have changed over time in the US, though a prior version of this project (now separate) additionally examined whether these trends have differed across State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) contexts.

To answer these questions, we use repeated cross-sectional data from the 1993-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and adopt an inter-categorical and non-parametric approach, estimating population trends over time across social groups defined individually and intersectionally by race, ethnicity, perceived sex, educational attainment, and household poverty status.
