# MH_inequity_trends_sEITC
This repository hosts analytic scripts for an ongoing project documenting how social inequities in mental health have changed over time and examining whether State EITC policies have modified these trends.

To answer these questions, we use repeated cross-sectional data from the 1993-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and adopt an inter-categorical and non-parametric approach, estimating population trends over time across social groups defined individually and intersectionally by race, ethnicity, perceived sex, educational attainment, and household poverty status.
